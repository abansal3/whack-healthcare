# Project Title

This is a web app built for the supply chain challenge by Partners In Health, a global health nonprofit that provides comprehensive health care in 10 countries around the world. It allows doctors in remote regions with poor internet connection to send medical requests to vendors. It also allows the vendors to better allocate their supplies and predict the demand for future orders. It collects the medical requests from doctors in those regions and processes the information in a relational database. It displays the order record for each vendor and provides data analysis for demands of each medicine in a dashboard.

Our codes use Twilio to process the SMS messages from users and send the information to database. Our codes use MySQL to create and maintain a relative database that includes database to keep records of vendors, doctors, medicine, vendor-medicine, doctor-orders. Our project uses Node.js to build the backend, AngularJS to communicate between the database and the front-end, HTM,CSS, JavaScript, Angular-chart.js for the front-end design.
